My "About Me" assignment

This assignment for Lab 2 is built around an "About Me" page that focuses most of the
content around myself (shocking). When the User enters my site, they will be alerted that a simple question game will begin. The first question prompts the user for their name and assigns it to the variable, "userName" for use in the next few questions.

The rest of the questions will be in the form of a YES or NO question using the confirm function. Whether or not the user says YES (ok) or NO (cancel) at any stage in the sequence of questions will result in different combinations of messages. The idea being to make these simple prompts seem more interactive.

The best part (IMO) happens if my user decides to be uncooperative when submitting a name.
My script will automatically assign the userName to "n00b," which is rather satisfying.
